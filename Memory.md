### Electronic Design

Memory is an Electronic holding place for the instructions and data.
It is used by the computer's operating system, hardware, and software.

#### An Example of RAM (Random Access Memory)Circuit

<img src='img/f-ram.jpg'>


+ <b>Capacitor</b>

<img src='img/capacitor.jpg'>
  
A capacitor  stores an electrical charge that represents a 1 or 0.

The capacitor is part of a memory cell that also contains a transistor. 

+ <b>Transistor</b>

  <img src='img/transistor.jpg'>

  Transistors are used in RAM  as switches to read and change the state of capacitors that store data

+ <b> Resistor</b>
  
<img src='img/resistor.jpg'>

  a type of passive electrical device that can change its resistance based on the history of voltage or current applied to it.
  
  Essentially, it is a non-volatile memory element that retains its state even when the power is turned off.
  

### Classification

<img src='img/memorytype.png'>

#### Primary Memory
   
Located directly on microchips on the motherboard that are physically close to a computer's microprocessor.

Memory is used as a synonym for primary memory 

For example: RAM

#### Secondary Memory (Second storage device)

For example: A hard drive or a hard disk drive (HDD) or USB
   
|Hardisk| Optical based Storage (DVD and Blu-ray)          | USB/Stick Float Gate Transitors | 
| :---------------- | :------: | :------: | 
|Magnetic storage. Data is stored as a magnetic pattern on a spinning disc coated with magnetic film| Bits are encoded as light and dark spots using a dye that can be read by laser| Store bits by trapping or removing electrical charges |

### Comparision

|Items| Primary Memory           | Secondary Memory [Storage] | 
| :---------------- | :------: | :------: | 
|Data storage|     volatile| nonvolatile |

## Memory Brief Introduction

[![Watch the video: Brief Introduction](https://nglthu.github.io/English_5_1_24/img/techtarget.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_M--weEzpA&t=119s)

[![Watch the video: How computer memory can work](https://nglthu.github.io/English_5_1_24/img/teded.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3q5zWCw8J4&list=PPSV&t=30s)


# Part III. Writing 
## Writing Technique of POWER

This new strategic technique is called the Power strategy. 
This strategy contains the following steps:

1. "P" which stands for picking ideas. In this stage, students are asked to think of what they are writing and this stage is considered to be pre-writing stage then students write freely and then choose the most important ideas to write about.
   
2. "O" refers to organizing ideas. In this stage, students put their ideas into well-organized order according to the sequence and the importance of the ideas.
   
3. "W" stands for writing and this stage is the stage of actual writing to what had been arranged before.
   
4. "E" means evaluating what had been written according to a writing rubric see appendix (A) and your supporting/evidence/experiment results.
   
5. "R" means re-examining and rereading what had been written to make sure of its quality.

## Short_paper

<h1>Writing Materials: Memory</h1>

"The semiconductor memories let aside the advancements in processor technologies now is being moved to the
center of renovation toward the future computers in the ultimate architecture. In his review, the roles and requirements of semiconductor memories for memory-oriented processors are investigated in the highlights of applications in the neuromorphic system
and processing-in-memory architectures (Seongjae, 2022).

Seongjae (2022) has reviewed some main points as below:

+ Architecture of a CNN accelerator with DRAM

+ Si-based floating-body synaptic transistor 

+ Quantum-well charge-trap synaptic transistor

+ Device structure of core-shell dual-gate nanowire synaptic transistor

+ Resistance-change Memory Synaptic Devices

+ Memory bottleneck in the serial-processing computers.

```


Please write a short paper to explain and discuss the point of view that:
Whether the transistors in Seonjae's review are "switches to read and change the state of capacitors (stores an electrical charge that represents a 1 or 0) that store data"


```

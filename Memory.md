# Part I. Lecturing about Memory
## 1. Brief Introduction
<img src='img/memory.png'>

### Definition

Memory is an Electronic holding place for the instructions and data.
It is used by the computer's operating system, hardware, and software.

### Classification

1. Primary Memory
   Located directly on microchips on the motherboard that physically close to a computer's microprocessor.

Memory is used as a synonym for primary memory 

   For example: RAM

2. Secondary Memory (Second storage device)

   For example: A hard drive or a hard disk drive (HDD)
   
   

### Comparision

|Items| Primary Memory           | Secondary Memory [Storage] | 
| :---------------- | :------: | :------: | 
|Data storage|     volatile| nonvolatile |
||    Short time  | Long Time |
||    Gone after power-off  | Remain |
|Performance| Fast|Slow|

# Part III. Writing 
## Writing Technique of POWER

This new strategic technique is called the Power strategy. 
This strategy contains the following steps:

1. "P" which stands for picking ideas. In this stage, students are asked to think of what they are writing and this stage is considered to be pre-writing stage then students write freely and then choose the most important ideas to write about.
   
2. "O" refers to organizing ideas. In this stage, students put their ideas into well-organized order according to the sequence and the importance of the ideas.
   
3. "W" stands for writing and this stage is the stage of actual writing to what had been arranged before.
   
4. "E" means evaluating what had been written according to a writing rubric see appendix (A) and your supporting/evidence/experiment results.
   
5. "R" means re-examining and rereading what had been written to make sure of its quality.

## Short_paper

<h1>Writing Materials: CPU</h1>

```
Gupta, K. and Sharma, T. (2021) said "The shift in the industry towards ARM processors can change how we write softwares which in turn will affect the whole software development environment."

Please write a short paper to explain and discuss these points of view.

![ARM vs x86](https://nglthu.github.io/English_5_1_24/img/x66_arm.png)

```
On page 26 of the book "ARM System of Chip Architecture" (The University of Manchester, n.d), it said "one of the drawbacks of RISC is when the processor incorporates an on-chip cache of a particular size, poor code density results in a smaller proportion of the working set being held in the cache at any time, increasing the cache miss rate, resulting in an even greater increase in the main memory bandwidth requirement and consequent power consumption."

Using the writing techniques of POWER, Good Style (Zobel, Justin, 2005) and  "so-called myth" of Linguistic injustice (Englander Karen, 2019, p.30), to research how Apple Chip can reduce power and have power efficiency in their model.

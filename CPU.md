### Core & Chip Level

![Core-Level and Chip-level](https://nglthu.github.io/English_5_1_24/img/Core-Chip-level.png)

```
Moore's law
is the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years.
Moore's law is an observation and projection of a historical trend.
Rather than a law of physics, it is an empirical relationship.
It is an experience-curve law, a type of law quantifying efficiency gains from experience in production.

# Writting 
## Technique

This new strategic technique is called the Power strategy. 
This strategy contains the following steps:

1. "P" which stands for picking ideas. In this stage, students are asked to think of what they are writing and this stage is considered to be pre-writing stage then students write freely and then choose the most important ideas to write about.
   
2. "O" refers to organizing ideas. In this stage, students put their ideas into well-organized order according to the sequence and the importance of the ideas.
   
3. "W" stands for writing and this stage is the stage of actual writing to what had been arranged before.
   
4. "E" means evaluating what had been written according to a writing rubric see appendix (A) and your supporting/evidence/experiment results.
   
5. "R" means re-examining and rereading what had been written to make sure of its quality.

## Short_paper

<h1>Writing Materials: Mainframe</h1>

```
What is the Moore's law applying in the current IBM Z/LinuxONE Mainframe ? How can clients infuse AI inferencing for real-time insights on IBM zSeries-the z16 2022 ?

Hutton, D. (2024) said "Moore’s Law is not dead yet, though we can see the checkered flag on the GPS” and "clients can infuse AI inferencing for real-time insights" on IBM zSeries-the z16 2022. 


Please write a short paper to explain and discuss these points of view and its applied technology.

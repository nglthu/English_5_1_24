## Technique

This new strategic technique is called the Power strategy. 
This strategy contains the following steps:

1. "P" which stands for picking ideas. In this stage, students are asked to think of what they are writing and this stage is considered to be pre-writing stage then students write freely and then choose the most important ideas to write about.
   
2. "O" refers to organizing ideas. In this stage, students put their ideas into well-organized order according to the sequence and the importance of the ideas.
   
3. "W" stands for writing and this stage is the stage of actual writing to what had been arranged before.
   
4. "E" means evaluating what had been written according to a writing rubric see appendix (A) and your supporting/evidence/experiment results.
   
5. "R" means re-examining and rereading what had been written to make sure of its quality.

## Short_paper

<h1>Writing Materials: Hardware & Software</h1>

```
The unpredictable phenomena of emergent abilities of large language model.
Model can generalize to random unseen compositions of some level of unpredictable abilities or skills.
Other phenomena that we probably are not aware of, and we need some understanding of that.
Language models can move beyond being stochastic parrots.
For example, Chat bot had some level of understanding but do these abilities reflect actual understanding?
Otherwise, model simply repeat its training data like so called stochastic parrots. 


Please write a short paper to overview of these above points in the 2024's Biggest Breakthroughs in Computer Science.
